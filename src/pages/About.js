      Some things are classic for a reason. Don't get us wrong, we love and inventive, over the top cocktail as much as anyone, but the timeless flavors of cocktails like the margarita, the Manhattan, and the martini are the cocktail version of comfort food, and we can't imagine imbibing without them. Whether you're brushing up on your home mixology menu or looking for a go-to order for your next cocktail hour, these classics will never steer you wrong.
